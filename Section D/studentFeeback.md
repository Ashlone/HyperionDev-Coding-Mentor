# Option 3: Student Feedback

Handling student concerns is an essential part of the mentorship role, and it's crucial to address the issue promptly and professionally. In this scenario, the student has responded irately to the feedback provided and has made a complaint on social media. To handle this situation, I would take the following steps:

1. Stay Calm and Professional: As a mentor, it's essential to remain calm and professional in all situations. I would take some time to compose myself and not respond immediately to the student's irate response or social media complaint.

2. Review the Feedback: I would review the feedback provided to the student and compare it to the specific points that the student has raised in their response. This would help me to identify any misunderstandings or miscommunications that may have occurred.

3. Reach Out to the Student: Once I have reviewed the feedback and have a clear understanding of the situation, I would reach out to the student to discuss their concerns. I would do this via the communication channel we typically use for the bootcamp. This may be Discord, or email.

4. Listen to the Student: During the conversation, I would listen to the student's concerns and try to understand their perspective. I would make sure to provide them with the opportunity to express their opinions and ask questions.

5. Explain the Feedback: After listening to the student, I would explain the feedback provided, clarify any misunderstandings, and provide examples to demonstrate the specific points being made. I would also explain how the feedback was personalized and actionable.

6. Address the Social Media Complaint: If the student has made a complaint on social media, I would address it promptly and professionally. l would reach out to the student through a private message and apologise for any misunderstanding or frustration the student may have experienced. l would let him or her know that l value his or her feedback and would be committed to improving his or her experience as a HyperionDev student.

7. Resolve the Issue: Once I have had a chance to explain the feedback, and the student has a better understanding of the feedback's value, I would work with the student to identify any additional resources or support that they may need to improve their work.

8. If the student continues to be irate and unresponsive, l would escalate the situation to the appropriate personnel within HyperionDev, such as a senior mentor or manager in charge of our team.This will help ensure that the situation is resolved in a professional and appropriate manner.
