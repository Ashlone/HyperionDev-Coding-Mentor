## Option 1: Student Progress



As a mentor for HyperionDev, it's essential to ensure that all students are making progress and staying on track with the bootcamp curriculum. In this situation, we have five students who are two weeks behind, ten students who are at risk of falling behind, and five students who are ahead of their expected progress. To get the lagging students back on track while ensuring that the at-risk and ahead-of-progress students are not negatively impacted, we can follow the intervention plan outlined below:

1. Schedule a one-on-one meeting with each of the five students who are two weeks behind. During the meeting, we will identify the specific reasons why they are behind and create an action plan to help them catch up. We will provide them with additional resources and support to help them get back on track.

2. For the ten students at risk of falling behind, we will send out a reminder message on the communicating channel and encourage them to prioritize their next task to avoid falling behind. We will provide them with extra support if they need it and make sure that they understand the importance of staying on track with the curriculum.

3. For the five students who are ahead of their expected progress, we will encourage them to continue their efforts and maintain their momentum. 

4. We will make ourselves available for additional one-on-one sessions for any student who needs additional support or guidance. We will be proactive in identifying and addressing any potential issues before they become a significant problem.

5. Encourage the students to join study groups, where they can collaborate with other students who are on track or ahead of schedule. This will help them get support and motivation from their peers, which can improve their progress.

6. Create a sense of urgency to all the students by emphasizing the importance of completing the task on time and the potential consequences of falling behind.


By following this intervention plan, we can help the five lagging students catch up, ensure that the ten at-risk students do not fall behind, and provide additional support and guidance to all students who need it. This will help us maintain high task completion and graduation rates for our bootcamps while ensuring that all students are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed.
