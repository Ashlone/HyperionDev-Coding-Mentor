# Regarding worst-case space complexity
## let's analyze the sayNumber() function:

We create an array numberGroups that contains the groups of three digits in the input number. The length of this array is at most ceil(log10(num + 1) / 3), which is the number of digits in the input number divided by 3 and rounded up. Therefore, the space complexity of this step is O(log(num)).

We create an array by mapping each group in numberGroups to its English name using the getNumber() function, and add the appropriate suffix using the numberSuffix() function. The length of this array is at most ceil(log10(num + 1) / 3), which is the same as the length of numberGroups. Therefore, the space complexity of this step is also O(log(num)).

We join the resulting array with commas and replace the final comma with 'and' if necessary. The length of the resulting string is at most ceil(log10(num + 1)), which is the number of digits in the input number. Therefore, the space complexity of this step is also O(log(num)).

Therefore, the overall worst-case space complexity of the sayNumber() function is O(log(num)).
