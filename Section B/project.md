## Why I'm Proud of This Project
I'm particularly proud of this project because l developed this full-stack web application from scratch for an interview test that l was supposed to submit within 3 days. It was a significant challenge to design the database schema, build the back-end, and create a responsive front-end using react. Overall, this project helped me develop my skills as a full-stack web developer and gave me a sense of accomplishment.
