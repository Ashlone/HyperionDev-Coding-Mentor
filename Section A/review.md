# Coding Review


## Correctness:
In the join method inside the sorted function call, there is no argument passed to the sorted function, so it will result in a syntax error.Assuming the error is fixed, the correctness of the code should be good. It correctly groups anagrams together by sorting the characters in each string and using the sorted string as a key in a dictionary. All strings that share the same sorted characters will be grouped together. The code then returns a list of these groups.

## Efficiency:
The solution has a time complexity of O(n * mlogm) where n is the number of words in the input list and m is the maximum length of the words. The space complexity is O(n). The solution is efficient for small inputs but may not be efficient for very large inputs.

## Style:
The code is well written  but variables are not more descriptive. However, the indentation in line 3 ,line 4 ,line 10 and line 11 are incorrect and should be fixed.There are no comments in the code, which makes it harder to understand the logic behind the code.


## Documentation:
The code does not have any documentation, which makes it harder to understand the logic behind the code

## Positive aspects:
The code from line 1 to 12 checks for anagrams in the given list of strings and groups them together.The code is well organized and easy to follow.


## Improvements:
Fix the indentation error in line 3 ,line 4 ,line 10 and line 11 to make the code more readable.In addition,pass an argument to the sorted function and add detailed comments explaining how the code works.However,the variable names could also be improved to be more descriptive to make the code more understandable.For example, instead of using x as a variable name, a more descriptive name like sorted_string could be used.
